# Reuter Developement Inspiration

"Clearing the path for your success"

The initial idea came from the definition of my name Reuter meaning clearing or clearer of the woodland eventually with the goal to make a farm.  

My last name is of German decendence and my grandparents and father were farmers. 

## Defining the Details

The logo is made up of three main different objects.

1. Path
2. Trees
3. Sun
4. Fields


## Path

The path is the guiding outline that I will give to clients in order to achieve the goals that they have in mind

Giving a path to your clients is so important in order to not only establish confidence in yourself but give confidence to your clients that you have all the details mapped out and they have nothing to worry about when they hire you to make your website.


##  Trees

The trees in my logo are the guide posts in your project that help establish markers that you can check as you make progress towards the main goal of creating a ecommerce website for example. 

## Sun

The sun is the goal that you are working towards, this could be an ecommerce, blog or point of contact website that you may be desiging. 

Be clear to define what is the sun that you are working towards when you propose an idea or audit to a potential client.


## Field Of Fruition

The fields of fruition on the sides is the work you are doing and to show or display that you are always growing in your skills as an individual and in my brand I want that to stand out.
